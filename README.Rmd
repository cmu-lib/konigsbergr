The goal of konigsbergr is to recreate the ["Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg) problem over any city by converting data from OpenStreetMap into a graph and traversing it.

## Installation

You can install the development version:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("cmu-lib/konigsbergr")
```

## Usage

Konigsbergr works with OSM data, transforming it into a graph object and then using the [pathfinder] package to traverse edges within it. The result is a pathway that will try to cross all the bridges in a given city.

For the complete manual, see [the package vignette](https://cmu-lib.github.io/konigsbergr/articles/konigsbergr.html).
